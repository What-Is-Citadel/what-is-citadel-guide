# Tasks — cli-account-privacy

Status: PARKED 072200ZMAY26 — Settings-panel concern, not a dev-loop workflow. No GitHub CLI analogue. Privacy preference toggles belong in a browser/UI settings surface; they are not actions a developer would need mid-session. Superseded by the CLI-as-workflow-tool principle.

## P0

- [ ] A1. Add `account privacy get`.
- [ ] A2. Add `account privacy set` with subset PATCH support.
- [ ] A3. Add handler and command-tree coverage for privacy verbs.

## P1

- [ ] B1. Document account privacy inspection and mutation.
- [ ] B2. `make verify` green.

## P2

- [ ] C1. Run live smoke for privacy get/set against the real daemon.
- [ ] C2. Spec close.
